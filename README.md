# Backboned v2

Backboned v2 is the follow-up to [Backboned](https://github.com/herschel666/Backboned) — an AJAX-Wordpress-theme powered by Backbone.js. I decided to create a new repository for this one, as the differences in the concept and the code are too large.

For usage go into your terminal and do …

	$ cd path/to/backboned-v2
	$ bower install

For further development install the Node-dependencies as well …

	$ npm install

## How does it work?

Backboned v2 is a mixture of [Require.js](http://requirejs.org) for modularization and script loading, [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.io/backbone/) as a client-side MVC and [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io) for templating (client- and server-side). While using the History-API, Backbone.js fetches the JSON-data and renders it into the DOM. On the server-side a controller sends the data due to the request type. There are three different types of requests:

1. The classical, synchronous request gets the website frame (with templates inside the DOM), the javascripts and the styles.
2. The asynchronous request gets the page's data in JSON-format.
3. The request with $_GET['\_escaped\_fragment\_']-parameter set, gets a static version of the page. Mustache is used on the server-side for rendering the page.

With this approach, the hashbang-method for pointing crawlers to the static content is used without hashbang-URIs.

Older browsers, that don't support the History-API, always make a round-trip after each anchor click. In the moment I'm not planning to include a workaround with hash-fragment-URIs for the old ones.

## What is this \_escaped\_fragment_-shizzle?

It's a way to serve the static content of a client-side rendered Javascript-application and make it thereby possible for search engines to crawl the application's content ([read more about it here](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/specification?hl=de)).

But in contrast to the specification Backboned v2 doesn't make use of hashbang-URIs. The `_escaped_fragment_`-parameter is just a vehicle for identifying requests made by search engine crawlers.

## How to use the theme?

Download the repo, put the folder into the `wp-content/themes/`-directory of your Wordpress-installation and make sure, the cache-folder is writeable. Otherwise Mustache will have to render a new template each time an `_escaped_fragment_`-request comes. This may really slow things down!

## Why not to use it?

Backboned v2 is in a really early state. Furthermore it's more like a proof-of-concept — is it possible to ajaxify a Wordpress-site with Backbone.js?! That's why you can't treat it like one of the fancy, blown-up themes from the official Wordpress-theme-directory (no disrespect!).

But if you're a developer and you're looking for this exact combination — Wordpress + Backbone.js — then you're in the right spot. Download it and take it as a base for your own work.

## Who built this?

Yeah, I like this question. Kind of &hellip;

I'm a frontend-developer from Hanover, Germany. You can follow me on [twitter (@Herschel_R)](http://twitter.com/Herschel_R) or [visit my blog](htpp://www.emanuel-kluge.de/). You can even do both.

## Where is the interesting license part?

Right here!
